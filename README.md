# Docker-Demo-Assignment
A demonstration of using Docker in a Linux Environment

The goal of this assignment was to configure a docker environment on any Linux distro of our choosing to familiarize ourselves with Docker environments.

Docker is used to provide a consistent coding environment between mulitple developers.  This eliminates per-device configuration/dependency issues and ensures the project being worked on runs consistently between multiple developers.
